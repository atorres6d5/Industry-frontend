Industry

Industry is an application that will help companies keep track of where there money is being spent and made, by keeping tracked of hours worked and where.

The setting for Industry is in a Manufacturing plant. Workers would use industry first to clock in for the day. after finding their assigned work for the day by their super, they would also clock into each project they are working on. At all times projects that are clocked into are viewed on the workers dashboard. 


At the end of the work day or when the project is complete, they would then claim their production for the day. How many parts made, both good and bad ones. Worker would not be able to clock out untill all data is entered.


Admins would be able to see who is active in their shop by viewing who is clocked in on their dashboard. It shows how long they have been there for the day and helps keep a head count. They can also view individual workes timecard data and which projects they have worked on. Admins can also add new users and deciede what type of accsess they have

Both Workers and Admins can see when projects are due and and if any are past due to help with ontime delevery. All users and filter projects by customer or project #
