# Industry

Industry is an application that helps companies keep track of where their money is being spent and made, by keeping track of hours worked and where.

The setting for Industry is in a Manufacturing shop. Workers would use industry first to clock in for the day. After finding their assigned work for the day by their super, they would also clock into each project they are working on. At all times projects that are clocked into are viewed on the workers dashboard. and time is being logged to that job.


At the end of the work day or when the project is complete, they would then claim their production for the day. How many parts made, both good and bad ones. Worker would not be able to clock out until all data for each job clocked into is logged.


Admins would be able to see who is active in their shop by viewing who is clocked in on their dashboard. It shows how long they have been there for the day and helps keep a head count. They can also view individual workers timecard data and which projects they have worked on. Admins can also add new users and decide what type of access they have

Both Workers and Admins can see when projects are due and and if any are past due to help with on time delivery. All users and filter projects by customer or project #
